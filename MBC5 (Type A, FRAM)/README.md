## Board Characteristics and Order Information

The zipped folder contains all the gerber files for this board. The following options **must** be chosen when ordering boards for yourself.

- Thickness: 0.8mm
- Layers: 2
- Surface Finish: ENIG
- Gold Fingers: Yes, 30Â° chamfer

You can use the zipped folder at any board fabricator you like. You may also buy the board from PCBWay using this link (disclosure: I receive 10% of the sale value to go towards future PCB orders of my own):

**PLEASE NOTE: I have not ordered these from PCBWay, so I cannot attest to their quality or performance. I have put the order details in as I believe they should be, but you need to review all parameters before ordering. Order at your own risk.**
